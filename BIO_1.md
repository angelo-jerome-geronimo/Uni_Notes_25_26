### Manifestations and Characteristics of Life

1. **_Built of Cells_**
- Recall that cells are the `basic building blocks` of life
- Cells are mainly `Eukaryotic` or `Prokaryotic`
- `Eukaryotes` have a `true nucleus`
- `Prokaryotes` have `no true nucleus`

2. **_Reproduction_**
- `Cell division` allows the formation of new cells
- `Offspring` as a result of parents' reproduction
- The DNA is passed down from parent to offspring
- DNA contains all the cell's genetic material
  
3. **_Development_**
- In humans, babies develop from the fertilization of an egg cell, which has the combined DNA from both parents

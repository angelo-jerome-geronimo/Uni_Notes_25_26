# The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House
*Audre Lorde*

## Poetry is Not a Luxury
- The first few lines are quite dense.
- How we live our lives, how we interact with society, is very much influenced by how we view ourselves and our existence.
- We act accordingly to how we see the world around us; it somehow dictates our roles in society.
- Poetry as illumination allows us to see the world from a different point of view.
- It acts as a catalyst for breaking from the status quo (of oppression).
- It is more than just freedom of expression; it serves as a revolutionary medium for the silenced and suppressed ideas and emotions.
- Poetry wants to break the walls of the "normal" society.
- Awareness of change is not enough; confront these changes and start from the ground up.
- A dammed river that can unleash a flash flood of change when restrictive walls are torn down.
- Simply repairing the current flawed system only prolongs the present situation.
- Weponize poetry to turn the fear and pain into a powerful drive to set changes in motion.
- Poetry is not merely an aesthetic form of art; it guides us through the darkness, exposing truths behind lies.
- Thoery alone is not enough; put this knowledge into practice and into action.
